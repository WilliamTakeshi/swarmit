"""Unified client interface for swarmit operations.

Two backends behind a single Protocol:

- LocalSwarmitClient: builds a `Controller` in-process. This is what the
  CLI has always done — ephemeral, one Controller per invocation, with
  the discovery wait that comes with it.

- HTTPSwarmitClient: talks to a long-lived `swarmit-server` over HTTP.
  The server's Controller stays subscribed continuously, so the CLI's
  cold-start tax disappears and stale-discovery flakes go with it.

`build_client(settings, no_server=False)` probes the server at
SWARMIT_SERVER_URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:8001`) and returns the
right backend. The probe is `GET /settings` with a 200 ms timeout; one
TCP connect-refused when no server is running, ~5 ms.
